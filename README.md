# TASK 3: Iris Flower Classification ðŸŒ¸  

## Overview  
This project is part of my internship with **CodSoft** and focuses on classifying iris flowers into three species:  
- Setosa  
- Versicolor  
- Virginica  

Using machine learning techniques, the model predicts the species of an iris flower based on its features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.  

## Dataset  
The dataset used is the classic **Iris dataset**, which you can find here:  
- [Iris Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset)  


## Objectives  
- Analyze the dataset and perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
- Train a classification model to achieve high accuracy in predicting the iris species.  
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.  

## Steps  
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**  
   - Visualized the dataset to understand feature distributions and correlations.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Checked for missing values and normalized the data for better performance.  

3. **Model Selection and Training**  
   - Implemented machine learning models like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree.  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated models using accuracy, confusion matrix.    

## Libraries and Tools  
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn
